The <em>Letter</em> template will set the text with the iA Writer Quattro typeface. It´s assumed letters are printed on DIN A4 paper or anything of roughly the same size. The sender, receiver, and the date of writing will be positioned correctly when printing the text with the <em>Letter</em> template. See below how the above text is formatted by the <em>Letter</em> template.
