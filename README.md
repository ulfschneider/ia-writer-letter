## A sample letter

See below a markdown-formatted letter in the iA Writer editor, with indication for the *sender-address,* the *receiver-address,* and the *date* of writing.

The *Letter* template will render the text with the *iA Writer Quattro* typeface. ItÂ´s assumed letters are printed on DIN A4 paper or anything of roughly the same size. The sender, receiver, and the date of writing will be positioned correctly when printing the text with the *Letter* template. See below how the above text is formatted by the *Letter* template.
